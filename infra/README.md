# Infra as Code stubs â€“ Sprint 0

This directory contains preliminary Terraform configuration files for the Core Pilot MVP infrastructure.

## Files

- `main.tf`: AWS provider configuration
- `variables.tf`: Input variables (aws_region, db_username, db_password)
- `outputs.tf`: Output values (RDS endpoint placeholder)

## Purpose

These files serve as placeholders for future infrastructure development. In subsequent sprints, 
they will be expanded to include:

- RDS database instance
- ECS/EKS clusters for container deployment
- S3 storage configuration
- CloudFront distribution
- VPC and networking resources
- IAM policies and roles

## Getting Started

This is a stub implementation only. No resources will be created if applied.
